User testing revealed a steep learning curve to unlock the product's full potential. Our task was to simplify the user experience and make the app more intuitive for a non-technical user base. What initially appeared as a straightforward assignment ultimately led us to redesign the app's core user flows while preserving the depth of its features."
        process={"To gain a comprehensive understanding of LoveFuel's product and its competitive landscape, we installed the app on our phones alongside several of its major competitors. This allowed us to analyze how other companies approached common UX patterns in the relationship market. We meticulously mapped out the functions and flows of various apps, deconstructing LoveFuel's features to assess their complexity. Subsequently, we created different wireframes and collaborated with the LoveFuel team to develop and test our new designs with their users, even while they were still a work in progress. This iterative approach enabled us to make informed decisions rapidly. As a result, we successfully redesigned the entire app, a move that secured them additional funding just a month later."}

By eliminating meetings and embracing asynchronous communication, we successfully designed their web app in just five days."

Throughout the day, we tackled various tasks and shared video updates with the Co-Coders team by day's end.

Given our tight deadline of just five days for the web app design, we opted for well-tested standard UX patterns, focusing on creating an approachable and user-friendly UI.

To validate their business idea, they wanted to expose their new service to a large user base. They had the perfect plan how to do that: Launching on Black Friday. The challenge was that Black Friday was only four weeks away.
               We teamed up with a handful of skilled engineers and managed to create a mini brand, design a eCommerce store complete with custom flows for handling the usersâ€™ old machines and launched the product just days before Black Friday. The service gained a lot of traction and continues to operate successfully today."

Establishing a shared vision of the final product was essential for fostering effective communication and working towards a common goal.

This exceptional teamwork was the driving force behind bringing the project to life."

Leveraging user behavior insights from their other sites, we could efficiently incorporate proven patterns with a high likelihood of success. With this foundational knowledge, we crafted a mini brand identity aimed at conveying a fresh and trustworthy image.

        In partnership with their internal content team, we focused on creating a straightforward and intuitive understanding of their product. Development had to start early to ensure enough time for testing and bug fixing, which meant we had to be very structured to determining which components were ready for development, while remaining open to rapid decision-making when dealing with edge cases."
